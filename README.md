# Quilty

I'm working towards a basic app for my wife so she can plan quilts she wants to make.

## Planned Initial Features
- Ability to display/hide dimension of panels
- Ability to add and resize borders/sashing
- Ability to create individual blocks for reuse (store locally)
- Blocks
-- Simple square shape
-- Split right triangle shape (can be rotated?)
-- Rectangle (2x simple square height or width)

## Future Features
- Export as PDF
- Import photos
- Draw custom blocks?
